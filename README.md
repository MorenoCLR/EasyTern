## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

```bash
# Install Node.js (LTS version recommended)
https://nodejs.org/

# Check versions
node -v
npm -v
```

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#Installation).

## Installation

Install EasyTern with npm

```bash
  cd easytern
  npm install
```
    
## Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API PUBLISHABLE OR ANON KEY]
  ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > This example uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, which refers to Supabase's new **publishable** key format.
  > Both legacy **anon** keys and new **publishable** keys can be used with this variable name during the transition period. Supabase's dashboard may show `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; its value can be used in this example.
  > See the [full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260) for more information.

  Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)
